#This repo included some knowledge point for React TIC-TAE-TOC tutorial

## Added the the impovement Idea:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
   **App.js line 55,56**

2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
   **Used RED color instead of bold**

3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
   **this.renderBoard() & this.renderBoard is different things!!**

4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
   
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.

6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.
